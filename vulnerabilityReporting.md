# How to report a Vulnerability


## Creating a Report
1. We have published a [vulnerability reporting template](./vulnerabilityTemplate.md) in this repository for you to use. This template will allow a vulnerability reporter and strongDM's Security Team to quickly understand, reproduce, and verify the vulnerability.

1. Vulnerability reporters should use the provided template, and include any additional information and/or files they find  

1. Place the completed template and any additional information or screenshots into a directory and wrap it into an archive using either `tar` or `zip`.


#### Encrypting a Report
The strongDM Security Team has a GPG key with the fingerprint of `1DB0 34C7 2D0C E04D C0F7  E0D9 B750 1097 5B5C BD5A` which should be used to encrypt all communications between a Vulnerability Reporter and strongDM.
